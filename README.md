# understanding-computation-with-javascript
A javascript translation of the excellent Ruby-based book "Understanding Computation"

## Purpose
The Book [understanding Computation (From Simple Machines to Impossible Programs)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449329276/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449329276&linkCode=as2&tag=glowinc-20&linkId=HT43C34OZU3YIHVV) is a great introduction to what is often called "computational theory" or "Foundations of Computer Science" (covering language concepts, automata, and computability) for the programmer who never went through the standard undergraduate course of Computer Science. I have been looking for a book like this for some time, but unfortunately all the example code is in Ruby. I thought translating the examples to javascript might be a good way to deepen my knowledge of Ruby while rigorously working through this interesting book. Enjoy.
